# multi_class_ROC
Codebase for 2006 Multi-class ROC paper


The repository is a collection of Matlab file associated with the paper:

Everson RM, Fieldsend JE. (2006) Multi-class ROC analysis from a multi-objective optimisation perspective, Pattern Recognition Letters, volume 27, no. 8, pages 918-927.

This is an *as is* codebase. I may revisit and clean up some aspects/commenting, but I've put it up due to community requests (as it pre-dates my use of GitHub, and release of nicely commented(?) code with publications as standard).
